      <description>Know some R? Share with our team!As we gear up for our third year of R-Ladies #LdnOnt, we are actively looking for people who would be interested in presenting a tutorial at one of our future meet ups. Our presenters have ranged from relatively new R users all the way up to seasoned R experts; the ideal R-Ladies tutorial presenter would fall anywhere along that continuum!
Goal: Skill-swappingOur main goal is to provide an environment in which people interested in learning R can share their skills and learn with other like-minded folks.</description>
