      <description>See you next year, R-Ladies!And thus concludes our final R-Ladies #LdnOnt event of 2018! Thanks to Daryn for leading our last workshop of the season, Transitioning from SPSS to R, version 2.0. We were a smaller crowd this time (that‚Äôs the end of the academic term, for you), but I think these are a great set of resources to have.
