      <description>Join us on Tuesday, November 12 at 6 pm to learn more about data viz.¬†They say a picture‚Äôs worth a thousand words‚Ä¶ Does that apply to figures?
Well, we think it does. Olivia Daub will be giving us a crash course in the Grammar of Graphics, taking us from the basics of ggplot2 to some fancy vizmagic with 3D graphics. Newbies and veterans alike will come away with new tricks, so don‚Äôt miss it!</description>
