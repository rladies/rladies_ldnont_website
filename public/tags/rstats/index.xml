      <description>See you next year, R-Ladies!And thus concludes our final R-Ladies #LdnOnt event of 2018! Thanks to Daryn for leading our last workshop of the season, Transitioning from SPSS to R, version 2.0. We were a smaller crowd this time (that‚Äôs the end of the academic term, for you), but I think these are a great set of resources to have.

      <description>Know some R? Share with our team!As we gear up for our third year of R-Ladies #LdnOnt, we are actively looking for people who would be interested in presenting a tutorial at one of our future meet ups. Our presenters have ranged from relatively new R users all the way up to seasoned R experts; the ideal R-Ladies tutorial presenter would fall anywhere along that continuum!
Goal: Skill-swappingOur main goal is to provide an environment in which people interested in learning R can share their skills and learn with other like-minded folks.</description>
