      <description>This year is flying by! We have 2 more meetups before our regular summer hiatus. For our upcoming March meetup (March 3, 2020, 6 pm, LPL Central) we’re going to do Lightning Talks.
These are quick 5-minute presentations on whatever you like. Really - anything. All levels of R proficiency are welcome! All topics are welcome! You can present on something you know well, something you’re in the midst of learning, or something you’d like to do and are just getting started with.</description>

Thank you to Jaky for leading us through our last workshop together, and to all of you who came out to these things over the last two and a half years. Workshop materials are posted in the usual places (website, GitHub, Drive).
Some news that I’ve spoken about a bit in person but not in any official capacity yet: Sally and I are stepping down as organizers.</description>

      <description>See you next year, R-Ladies!And thus concludes our final R-Ladies #LdnOnt event of 2018! Thanks to Daryn for leading our last workshop of the season, Transitioning from SPSS to R, version 2.0. We were a smaller crowd this time (that’s the end of the academic term, for you), but I think these are a great set of resources to have.
