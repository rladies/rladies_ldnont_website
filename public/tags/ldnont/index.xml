      <description>See you next year, R-Ladies!And thus concludes our final R-Ladies #LdnOnt event of 2018! Thanks to Daryn for leading our last workshop of the season, Transitioning from SPSS to R, version 2.0. We were a smaller crowd this time (that‚Äôs the end of the academic term, for you), but I think these are a great set of resources to have.

      <description>One of our R-Ladies members is co-piloting a new venture that some of you who are Western grad students may be interested in: a group for people interested in Computational Social Science. See more below! Note this is not an R-Ladies event, but may feature content that overlaps with many of our members‚Äô interests.
Calling all Western graduate students!If you are interested in Causal Inference/ Machine Learning/ Quantitative Methods and the social sciences - a group of graduate students at Western are organizing a new club focusing on Computational Social Science!</description>
