      <description>One of our R-Ladies members is co-piloting a new venture that some of you who are Western grad students may be interested in: a group for people interested in Computational Social Science. See more below! Note this is not an R-Ladies event, but may feature content that overlaps with many of our membersâ€™ interests.
Calling all Western graduate students!If you are interested in Causal Inference/ Machine Learning/ Quantitative Methods and the social sciences - a group of graduate students at Western are organizing a new club focusing on Computational Social Science!</description>
