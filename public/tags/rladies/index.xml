      <description>This year is flying by! We have 2 more meetups before our regular summer hiatus. For our upcoming March meetup (March 3, 2020, 6 pm, LPL Central) we‚Äôre going to do Lightning Talks.
These are quick 5-minute presentations on whatever you like. Really - anything. All levels of R proficiency are welcome! All topics are welcome! You can present on something you know well, something you‚Äôre in the midst of learning, or something you‚Äôd like to do and are just getting started with.</description>

      <description>Know some R? Share with our team!As we gear up for our third year of R-Ladies #LdnOnt, we are actively looking for people who would be interested in presenting a tutorial at one of our future meet ups. Our presenters have ranged from relatively new R users all the way up to seasoned R experts; the ideal R-Ladies tutorial presenter would fall anywhere along that continuum!
Goal: Skill-swappingOur main goal is to provide an environment in which people interested in learning R can share their skills and learn with other like-minded folks.</description>
