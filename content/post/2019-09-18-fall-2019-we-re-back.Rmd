# **We're back!**  

Welcome back to another year of #RLadies #LdnOnt!  This year we are starting out with three NEW organizers of R-Ladies London: **Olivia, Caitlin and Daryn**.  


### A little bit about us:  


All three of us are 4th year combined speech-language pathology MClSc/PhD candidates (yes, we met through that!).

<p> I’m [**Olivia**](https://twitter.com/OliviaDaub), my work focuses on partnering with speech-language pathologists in developing new measures of spoken language development for young children with hearing loss. I use R for a variety of psychometric analyses, including Rasch and Latent Trait’s Modelling, and an in the process of learning [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) for future manuscripts. I also have a pet bunny named Milo `r emo::ji("rabbit")` who has made significant contributions to my research, including eating any spare journal articles left lying around.</p>

Hi everyone! [**Caitlin**](https://twitter.com/CaitlinCoughler) here! I’ve been using R for about 2.5 years now, which started at #Rladies #LdnOnt! I took the deep dive last summer when I started using R in my candidacy exam project data analysis and haven’t looked back. I’m a big fan of the data manipulation packages tidyr and [dplyr](https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/data_wrangling) and love the graphing possibilities in [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). Fun fact: I’ve lived in 3 different continents. `r emo::ji("globe")` Looking forward to another year expanding R knowledge!

I’m [**Daryn**](https://twitter.com/DarynSparrow)! I too got starting using R at #Rladies #LdnOnt in 2017! From fresh-faced newbie to giving talks, R-Ladies has been a great place to grow. I use R for statistical analysis and data manipulation in my research (acoustic analysis of speech). I love the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) in general, and really appreciate [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/articles/overview.html) (for flexible and conditional table formatting). Outside of R, I love D&D `r emo::ji("dice")`, video games `r emo::ji("video game")` and textile arts!
