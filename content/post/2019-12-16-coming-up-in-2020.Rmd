**January 14th, 2020:** 

Our fearless leader Thea Knowles is coming back to visit us and to share her `rmarkdown` and `bookdown` wisdom with us. This will also be the month that marks 3 awesome years of R-Ladies London, and we're so thrilled to have her with us to celebrate our birthday `r emo::ji("birthday")`! She gave us an amazing talk on dissertating in R, and we're thrilled to have her back! R Markdown is a very helpful tool, no matter what you use R for. Whether it's reporting results of analyses at work or in research or writing websites exactly like this one (yay for `blogdown`!), R Markdown is your friend. Bookdown helps you expand your R Markdown forte to handle larger projects with *beautiful* output. Don't miss it! See you at LPL Central at 6 pm on January 14th. 

**February 11th, 2020:**

Many of us look on in wistful envy when we see someone [using Shiny for awesome dashboards and visualizations](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/). No more! Emma Smith is one of the cool Shiny kids, and she's coming to share that knowledge so we too can be those cool people. We are so excited, and you should be too! LPL central at 6 pm on February 11th is the place to be. 

Keep an eye on our [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ldnont/) to RSVP and [twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesLdnOnt) for more details as we get closer!
