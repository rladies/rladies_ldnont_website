<p>Join us on Tuesday, November 12 at 6 pm to learn more about data viz.Â They say a pictureâ€™s worth a thousand wordsâ€¦ Does that apply to figures?</p>

<p>Well, we think it does. Olivia Daub will be giving us a crash course in the Grammar of Graphics, taking us from the basics of ggplot2 to some fancy vizmagic with 3D graphics. Newbies and veterans alike will come away with new tricks, so donâ€™t miss it!</p>
<p>Come with R and R Studio installed, as well as the following packages: <strong>ggplot2, scatterplot3d, gvlma, rgl, car, rcmdr, and psych</strong>. Mac users may need to have xQuartz installed to render 3D graphics.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ll be in Room 2510 again at Elborn College (1201 Western Road). Parking is ðŸ’° free ðŸ’° after 4! This is our last meetup at Western, as weâ€™ll be back in our regular home at London Public Library starting next month (December 3rd)!!! Weâ€™ll have signs up to guide you, just like last time.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ldnont/events/265754543/">RSVP</a> at our Meetup page, and <a href="https://twitter.com/RLadiesLdnOnt">tweet</a> us if youâ€™ve got any questions or things youâ€™re dying to know that Olivia could try to touch on.</p>

<h2>How do I get there???</h2>
<p>Elborn is at the northwest corner of Western and Sarnia Road (vehicular entrances are both on Western Road).</p>
<p>There are many doors to Elborn, but the one that I think is the simplest for the room weâ€™re in is the <strong>red star</strong> on the map below. This door is on the south side of the building in the west part of the parking lot. If you come in this door, turn right and immediately left to go up a set of stairs. At the top of the stairs, go left through the door into a walkway with natural light and go into the offices across the walkway. Turn left at the first opportunity and go straight to the end of the hall - there we are!</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll try to have some signs up near the other doors and weâ€™ll be around to guide you on your journey.</p>
