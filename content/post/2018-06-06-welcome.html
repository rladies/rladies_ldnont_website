<h1>What is this R-Ladies you speak of?</h1>
<p><a href="rladies.org">R-Ladies</a> is a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community. <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is a powerful (and free!) software system for statistical analysis, data visualization and graphics, and a toooonnnnnn more. It has a huge beautiful and helpful community, but can be a bit tricky to learn on your own. That’s where R-Ladies comes in.</p>
<p>Our group hosts monthly-ish meet ups that feature workshops and tutorials on various topics related to R. Topics in the past have included learning to make plots, R for SPSS users, R in Industry, and a ton more. Check out our past meet ups <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ldnont/events/past/">here</a>.</p>
