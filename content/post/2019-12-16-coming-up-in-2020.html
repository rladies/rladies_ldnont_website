<p>Our fearless leader Thea Knowles is coming back to visit us and to share her <code>rmarkdown</code> and <code>bookdown</code> wisdom with us. This will also be the month that marks 3 awesome years of R-Ladies London, and weâ€™re so thrilled to have her with us to celebrate our birthday ðŸŽ‚! She gave us an amazing talk on dissertating in R, and weâ€™re thrilled to have her back! R Markdown is a very helpful tool, no matter what you use R for. Whether itâ€™s reporting results of analyses at work or in research or writing websites exactly like this one (yay for <code>blogdown</code>!), R Markdown is your friend. Bookdown helps you expand your R Markdown forte to handle larger projects with <em>beautiful</em> output. Donâ€™t miss it! See you at LPL Central at 6 pm on January 14th.</p>

<p>Many of us look on in wistful envy when we see someone <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/">using Shiny for awesome dashboards and visualizations</a>. No more! Emma Smith is one of the cool Shiny kids, and sheâ€™s coming to share that knowledge so we too can be those cool people. We are so excited, and you should be too! LPL central at 6 pm on February 11th is the place to be.</p>
