Our first meetup is in less than 2 weeks! This meetup will be on Tuesday, October 1st at 6 pm at Elborn College, Western University (1201 Western Road) in Room 2510. Elborn is a bit of a maze - see map and directions below. Parking at Elborn is `r emo::ji("moneybag")` free `r emo::ji("moneybag")` after 4 pm. 

We're very excited to have Dr. Cortney Hanna-Benson back to take us through some helpful introductory info! These workshops are always helpful for novice and experience users alike, as you sometimes come across tips you *wish* you had heard ages ago. 

It's also a great time to come and meet fellow R-Ladies members, offer ideas of talks you want to hear or meetups you'd like to have, or offer to present yourself! Don't think you need to be a pro to present - we welcome presenters at various levels of experience and we can help you think out how to present a topic you're interested in. 

Dr. Cortney Hanna-Benson is an educational developer and R enthusiast. Cortney uses R for both work and play. While she uses R for her statistical analyses and in teaching research methods at the University of Western Ontario, she also uses R to mine the web and to create stunning, interactive visuals.  She has offered a couple of workshops for R-Ladies in the past, including the inaugural meeting of the London, Ontario chapter.

In this step-by-step workshop, we will go over the basics of R and R Studio. This workshop is geared towards new R users, but there will also be opportunities to explore R beyond the basics at your own pace.  It’s a good idea to come prepared with your technology and with R and R Studio downloaded on your device:

- [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)

- [Download R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

## How do I get there???

Elborn is at the northwest corner of Western and Sarnia Road (vehicular entrances are both on Western Road). 

There are many doors to Elborn, but the one that I think is the simplest for the room we're in is the **red star** on the map below. This door is on the south side of the building in the west part of the parking lot. If you come in this door, turn right and immediately left to go up a set of stairs. At the top of the stairs, go left through the door into a walkway with natural light and go into the offices across the walkway. Turn left at the first opportunity and go straight to the end of the hall - there we are!

We'll try to have some signs up near the other doors and we'll be around to guide you on your journey.
