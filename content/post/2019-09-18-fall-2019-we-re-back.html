I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/OliviaDaub"><strong>Olivia</strong></a>, my work focuses on partnering with speech-language pathologists in developing new measures of spoken language development for young children with hearing loss. I use R for a variety of psychometric analyses, including Rasch and Latent Trait’s Modelling, and an in the process of learning <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html">RMarkdown</a> for future manuscripts. I also have a pet bunny named Milo 🐰 who has made significant contributions to my research, including eating any spare journal articles left lying around.

<p>Hi everyone! <a href="https://twitter.com/CaitlinCoughler"><strong>Caitlin</strong></a> here! I’ve been using R for about 2.5 years now, which started at #Rladies #LdnOnt! I took the deep dive last summer when I started using R in my candidacy exam project data analysis and haven’t looked back. I’m a big fan of the data manipulation packages tidyr and <a href="https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/data_wrangling">dplyr</a> and love the graphing possibilities in <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot</a>. Fun fact: I’ve lived in 3 different continents. 🌐 Looking forward to another year expanding R knowledge!</p>

<p>I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/DarynSparrow"><strong>Daryn</strong></a>! I too got starting using R at #Rladies #LdnOnt in 2017! From fresh-faced newbie to giving talks, R-Ladies has been a great place to grow. I use R for statistical analysis and data manipulation in my research (acoustic analysis of speech). I love the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> in general, and really appreciate <a href="https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/articles/overview.html">flextable</a> (for flexible and conditional table formatting). Outside of R, I love D&amp;D 🎲, video games 🕹 and textile arts!</p>
