On Tuesday, December 3rd at 6 pm, the wonderful [Jaky Kueper](https://twitter.com/jk_kueper) will be enlightening us on how to go on a data *adventure*. 

Jaky has taken us through a cleaning and exploration workshop before, and she's awesome! Come and join us to learn some common practices and procedures for data cleaning and exploration — how to get data into a ‘usable’ form and start looking at what they can tell you. We will touch on working with multiple datasets (joins) and strategies for when you need to learn more about your data or where they come from. This workshop is appropriate for all skill levels! 

There will be time for the group to skill-share and practice/troubleshoot; if you have new data that you are or will be working with this summer, bring it!
*Important* to remember is that we are back at our home at the London Public Library Central Branch! We'll be in the Stevenson and Hunt A Room - we'll have signs! Parking is free if you park in the Citi Plaza lot - entrance on King. Bring your parking pass to the library's main service desk and tell them you're with R-Ladies to get your parking validated. 

**London Public Library - Central**

After we've filled our heads with cleaning and exploration knowledge, we'll explore our way right over to our favourite Milos' for great beer and better company. See you all very soon! Please [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ldnont/) at our meetup page, and [tweet](https://twitter.com/RLadiesLdnOnt) us if you've got any questions about our upcoming meetup.
