# Join us!

This month's workshop, led by [Thea Knowles](http://theaknowles.com/), will focus on learning to make lovely graphics using the `ggplot` package. We will cover the basics as well as delve into more advanced options for customizing your figures.

We will also touch on:

- using [RProjects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) for a reproducible workflow
- reading in and manipulating data
- saving plots to certain specifications

Come with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed. We will need the package `ggplot2` for this workshop, so if you don't have it already, go ahead and install it in R using the line:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

If you have trouble, feel free to reach out to us at ldnont@rladies.org.

See you then! As usual, those who want to head with us to Milos' afterwards are welcome!
