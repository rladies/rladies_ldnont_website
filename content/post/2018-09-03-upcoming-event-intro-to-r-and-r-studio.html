<p>Welcome back for another season of R-Ladies, London ON (#LdnOnt)! Our kickoff event this fall is an introductory crash course to R (i.e., using the R programming language) and RStudio (the integrated developing environment (IDE)/handy user interface for using R). All are welcome, be you a total newbie to R or even if you are a well-seasoned programmer looking to get a refresher on the basics.</p>
<p>We are extraordinarily excited to welcome back <strong>Cortney Hanna-Benson</strong> as our workshop leader. Cortney led our very first R-Ladies #LdnOnt workshop back in January 2017, and we have been looking forward to having her again ever since.</p>
<p>If you can, come with R and RStudio already installed, but if you have trouble or are unable to, don‚Äôt let that hold you back. The workshop will be a mix of presentation and hands-on exercises. You are welcome to follow along actively or passively.</p>
