<h1>Join us!</h1>
<p>This month‚Äôs workshop, led by <a href="http://theaknowles.com/">Thea Knowles</a>, will focus on learning to make lovely graphics using the <code>ggplot</code> package. We will cover the basics as well as delve into more advanced options for customizing your figures.</p>
<p>We will also touch on:</p>
<ul>
<li>using <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects">RProjects</a> for a reproducible workflow</li>
<li>reading in and manipulating data</li>
<li>saving plots to certain specifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Come with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">RStudio</a> installed. We will need the package <code>ggplot2</code> for this workshop, so if you don‚Äôt have it already, go ahead and install it in R using the line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If you have trouble, feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:ldnont@rladies.org">ldnont@rladies.org</a>.</p>
<p>See you then! As usual, those who want to head with us to Milos‚Äô afterwards are welcome!</p>
