<h2>Know your city, plot your city!</h2>
<p>This workshop, led by Rebecca Henderson, will focus on learning to produce heatmaps and pointmaps using the Google maps platform. Heatmaps can be used to represent population density, per-capita income, social views, and many other geographically important measurements.</p>
<p>Rebecca, a PhD candidate in Health Sciences, researches cycling-motorist collisions and attitudes and barriers to cycling uptake in the City of London. We are thrilled to have her present, and are pretty excited that we‚Äôll be getting our hands on data actually relevant to our own fair city of London.</p>
<div id="some-prep-work-required" class="section level3">
<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Some prep work required</h3>
<p>There is some prep work to do beforehand if you‚Äôd like to actively follow along at the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>This workshop requires an <strong>API console key</strong>. Using Google Maps to a certain degree is free, but you must enable billing.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/superkoders/ultimate-guide-to-google-maps-d86ad945636a">Medium wrote a good article explaining the process that you can use to get set up.</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You‚Äôll also need to install the following packages if you don‚Äôt have them already. You can do this by running the line
<ul>
<li><code>install.packages(c("gdata", "tidyverse", "ggmap", "viridis"))</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have trouble, feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:ldnont@rladies.org" class="email">ldnont@rladies.org</a>. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable setting up the API console key (since you do need a credit card), that‚Äôs okay too. As always, you are more than welcome to come and follow along at your leisure or to tag-team with another member. However, if you‚Äôd like to actively follow along with Rebecca, you will need the API key.</p>
<p>See you then! As usual, those who want to head with us to Milos‚Äô afterwards are welcome! üçª</p>
