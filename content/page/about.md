# Welcome to the new landing site of R-Ladies London, Ontario!

The R-Ladies London, Ontario chapter (aka R-Ladies #LdnOnt) has been in operation since January 2017. Check out [this post](http://theaknowles.com/post/reflection-a-year-of-r-ladies-ldnont/) to learn more about how we got started and where we are now. This site will serve as a central landing point for anyone wishing to know more about us or access our materials.

# What is this R-Ladies you speak of? 
[R-Ladies](rladies.org) is a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a powerful (and free!) software system for statistical analysis, data visualization and graphics, and a toooonnnnnn more. It has a huge beautiful and helpful community, but can be a bit tricky to learn on your own. That's where R-Ladies comes in. 

Our group hosts monthly-ish meet ups that feature workshops and tutorials on various topics related to R. Topics in the past have included learning to make plots, R for SPSS users, R in Industry, and a ton more. Check out our past meet ups [here](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ldnont/events/past/). 

# FAQs

- Do I need to bean R expert? No! While some familiarity helps, all levels are welcome! If you want to follow along, come with your laptop and have R and RStudio installed. 
- I already know R, what's in it for me? Awesome! Come join a community of women interested in STEM research, meet new pals, learn new skills or sharpen old ones, or talk to us about leading a workshop on a topic you're passionate about!
- I don't identify as a lady, but I still want to learn R - can I join? Yes! While we prioritize female/non-binary leadership, our general membership is fully inclusive.
- I'm interested in leading a workshop! How to I get in touch? Great! You don't even need to be a full fledged "expert" to lead a workshop... this is a group for skill swapping. If you're interested, send us an [email](ldnont@rladies.org).
